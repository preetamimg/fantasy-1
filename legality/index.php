            <p>Yes, playing on fantasyis 100% legal. fantasyis a game of “skill”. The relevant law  in India is  clear that, unlike “ Games of Chance” games which substantially require a player to apply his skills are absolutely legal.</p>
            <div class="col-12 fw-bold text-dark mb-2">Who are Eligible to play on fantasy?</div>
            <p>fantasyis strictly for users who are atleast 18 years of age.</p>
            <p>However, if you are accessing this site/mobile application from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Telangana, Sikkim or Nagaland, users can enjoy our practice contests. The law in the above mentioned states is unclear on playing games of skill with entry fees for cash prizes. You are therefore prohibited from playing cash contests on fantasyfrom any of these states.</p>
